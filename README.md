# Easy-Ping-Pong-Game-Python
This project will show you how much easy it is to build a classic ping-pong game using Python's Turtle module. It is also great way to understand the concepts of class, objects and inheritance for a begineer while coding this game. It is designed in way that when anyone of the two paddles hit the ball, the ball bounces. When a paddle misses to hit the ball, the other player's score is incremented by one. The color of the ball changes every round after a player has scored a point. The speed of ball increases after every hit and goes back to normal after a player has scored a point.
